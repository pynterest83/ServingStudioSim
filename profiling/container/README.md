# vLLM profiler container

This image is the dependency boundary for ServingStudio Sim kernels registered with
`subprocess_env="vllm_env"`. It pins CUDA 13.0, the instrumented vLLM checkout,
the matching cu130 native wheel, Torch, FlashInfer, and the CUPTI build tools.
Workers run with `--network none`, so the build also downloads every FlashInfer
cubin into `/opt/flashinfer-cubins`.

By default, profiling workers overlay the current worktree's `profiling/`,
`launcher/`, and `gpu/` directories read-only. This development mode lets newly
registered profilers run immediately while keeping vLLM, its virtual
environment, and native extensions frozen inside the image.

For a release measurement whose source must also be frozen, use the source
snapshot baked into a clean image:

```bash
VIBESIM_PROFILE_SOURCE_MODE=image uv run python -m profiling run ...
```

Build from a clean checkout:

```bash
profiling/container/build.sh
```

During implementation only, a dirty image must be requested explicitly:

```bash
VIBESIM_ALLOW_DIRTY_PROFILE_IMAGE=1 profiling/container/build.sh
```

Build the image, then use the existing host CLI. Registry rows selecting
`vllm_env` automatically execute their worker chunk in the container:

```bash
uv run python -m profiling run nvfp4_quant \
  --backend vllm_cuda \
  --gpu-name "NVIDIA B200" \
  --spec '{"num_tokens":32,"hidden_size":6144,"group_size":16,"input_dtype":"bf16","scale_format":"linear_e4m3"}' \
  --json
```

The host remains responsible for GPU selection, profile DB writes, and artifact
creation. Development workers additionally receive the three read-only source
overlays described above. All workers receive a temporary JSON exchange
directory and a persistent JIT cache mounted at `/cache`; the cache-free
`kernel-profile measure` diagnostic additionally mounts its explicit output
directory so the container-owned CUPTI/NVML artifacts survive the worker. Plot
rendering remains optional and never controls measurement success. Set
`VIBESIM_PROFILE_GPUS` only to GPUs reserved for the profiling job; otherwise
the existing idle-GPU selection remains active.

Release measurements require `VIBESIM_PROFILE_SOURCE_MODE=image` and an image
built from a clean tree. Record both the immutable image digest and the labels
reported by:

```bash
docker image inspect vibesim-profiler-vllm:cu130-3f667d7e
```

## Hosts without Docker

On a machine that cannot run Docker (an unprivileged Kubernetes pod, for
example), set `VIBESIM_VLLM_PROFILE_ENV=host`. `vllm_env` rows then run as host
subprocesses of `alignment/profiler/vllm/.venv/bin/python`, isolated like
`vllm_upstream_fork_env` (the checkout and this repository on `PYTHONPATH`,
inherited site-packages dropped, the venv's Torch libraries first). Create
that environment exactly as the fork's `ALIGNMENT.md` describes. A host run is
only as reproducible as that checkout, so record its commit with the
measurement; the image remains the default and the release path.

The container does not virtualize the GPU driver. Validate the target GPU,
driver, and a real production kernel after every image or host-driver change.
